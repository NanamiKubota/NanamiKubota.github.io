I am a PhD student in the [Cooper Lab](http://micropopbio.org/) at the University of Pittsburgh. My research is on bacteria and phage evolution, and I am interested in applications of evolutionary game theory to microbial evolution. I mainly do research with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and Pf phage, a filamentous phage integrated in many *P. aeruginosa* strains, including PAO1 and PA14.

My initial motivation for creating this website was to centralize and organize my dry lab tutorials in one place. I try to update this site frequently so please let me know if you have any questions or run into issues.
