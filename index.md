I am a PhD student in the [Cooper Lab](http://micropopbio.org/) at the University of Pittsburgh. My research is on bacteria-phage coevolution with applications of evolutionary game theory. I work with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and Pf phage, a filamentous phage that is found integrated in many *P. aeruginosa* strains, including PAO1 and PA14.

My initial motivation for creating this website was so that all of my dry lab tutorials for the lab were in one place, instead of having them scattered throughout different channels and private messages in the lab's Slack workspace. This website is still under construction but hopefully, I will have a relatively functioning website that may (or may not) be useful to other lab members while learning a few things about coding in the process.
