I am a PhD student in the [Cooper Lab](http://micropopbio.org/) at the University of Pittsburgh. My research is on bacteria-phage coevolution, and I am currently attempting to integrate applications of evolutionary game theory into my work. I mainly do research with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and Pf phage, a filamentous phage that is found integrated in many *P. aeruginosa* strains, including PAO1 and PA14.

My initial motivation for creating this website was so that all of my dry lab tutorials for the lab were in one place, instead of having them scattered throughout different channels and private messages in the lab's Slack workspace and my Google Drive. As of June of 2023, I am starting to also integrate my dry lab notes here for better record keeping.
