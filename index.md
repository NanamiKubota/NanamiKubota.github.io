I am a PhD student in the [Cooper Lab](http://micropopbio.org/) at the University of Pittsburgh. My research is on bacteria and phage evolution, and I am interested in applications of evolutionary game theory to microbial evolution. I mainly do research with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and Pf phage, a filamentous phage integrated in many *P. aeruginosa* strains, including PAO1 and PA14.

My initial motivation for creating this website was to centralize and organize my dry lab tutorials in one place.

This website is hosted using GitHub Pages, and the repository can be found on my GitHub.
