I am a PhD student in the [Cooper Lab](http://micropopbio.org/) at the University of Pittsburgh. My initial motivation for creating this website was so that all of my up-to-date tutorials for the lab were in one place, instead of having them all scattered throughout different channels and private messages in the lab Slack workspace.

This website is still under construction but hopefully, I will have a relatively functioning website that may (or may not) be useful to other lab members while learning a few things about coding in the process.
