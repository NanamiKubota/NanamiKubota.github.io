My initial motivation for creating this website was so that all of my up-to-date tutorials for the lab were in one place, instead of having them all scattered throughout different channels and private messages in the lab Slack workspace.

This website is still under construction as I am in the midst of learning how to navigate GitHub, Jekyll, etc. I do not have a background in computer science, unfortunately. Hopefully by the end of this, I will have a relatively functioning website that may (or may not) be useful to other lab members while learning a few things about coding in the process.

The list of available tutorials are below:

## Getting started

> [Basics in R](/tutorials/basics_in_R): Goes over how to install R and RStudio, as well as some basic functions.

## Graphing

> [gbk to genome map](/tutorials/gbk_to_genome_map): Convert GenBank files (.gbk files) to linear genome maps.

## breseq

> [Running breseq](/tutorials/breseq): Step-by-step tutorial on how to run breseq on the lab's beagle server.

## Other

> [Defense Finder](/tutorials/defense_finder): Tool that finds antiviral systems in prokaryotic genomes.
