This page contains a compilation of dry lab tutorials that I have written over the years. It is still under construction as I am taking a crash course on website building with Jekyll. I am slowly integrating all of my tutorials onto the website so please let me know if you find an error anywhere. Hopefully by the end of this, I will have a relatively functioning website that may (or may not) be useful to other lab members while learning a few things about coding in the process.

The list of currently available tutorials are below:

## Getting started

> [Basics in R](/tutorials/basics_in_R): Goes over how to install R and RStudio, as well as some basic functions.

## Graphing

> [gbk to genome map](/tutorials/gbk_to_genome_map): Convert GenBank files (.gbk files) to linear genome maps.

## breseq

> [Running breseq](/tutorials/breseq): Step-by-step tutorial on how to run breseq on the lab's beagle server.

## Other

> [Defense Finder](/tutorials/defense_finder): Tool that finds antiviral systems in prokaryotic genomes.
