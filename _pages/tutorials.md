This page contains a compilation of dry lab tutorials that I have written over the years. It is still under construction as I am taking a crash course on website building with Jekyll. I am slowly integrating all of my tutorials onto the website so please let me know if you find an error anywhere. Hopefully by the end of this, I will have a relatively functioning website that may be useful to other lab members that need help with dry lab work.

The list of currently available tutorials are below:

## Getting started

> [Basics in R](/tutorials/basics_in_R): Goes over how to install R and RStudio, as well as some basic functions.

## Graphing

> [gbk to genome map](/tutorials/gbk_to_genome_map): Convert GenBank files (.gbk files) to linear genome maps using the gggenes package in R.

>[Graph multiple sequence alignment](/tutorials/multiple_sequence_alignment): Take your FASTA sequence file and do multiple sequence alignment in Geneious before plotting it in R.

>[Growth curves](/tutorials/growth_curve): Convert 96-well plate reader data to growth curves in R and calculate area under the curve, carrying capacity, and growth rate using the Growthcurver package.

## breseq

> [Running breseq](/tutorials/breseq): Step-by-step tutorial on how to run breseq on the lab's beagle server.

## Other

> [DefenseFinder](/tutorials/defense_finder): Tool that finds antiviral systems in prokaryotic genomes.

> [Retrieving old locus tags](/tutorials/old_locus_tag): Extract old locus tags from GenBank files.

## Resources for learning a new programming language

Below are a list of websites that may be useful for learning a new programming language. 

> [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/): free, project-based learning module. I recommend their html and CSS course for those who want to knit R markdown to nice html files. Also a great foundation if you ever want to build a website on GitHub Pages.

> [Exercism](https://exercism.org/): free and has over 60 different languages available. I haven't tried it myself but I heard it was good.

> [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/): 7-day free trial for different learning modules. I recommend their "Learn the Command Line" course for Cooper Lab users who want to use beagle. Their "Learn Bash Scripting" is okay and goes over basic syntax but not as well-built as the command line tutorial. The modules is shorter though so if you have time during your free trial, go for it.
