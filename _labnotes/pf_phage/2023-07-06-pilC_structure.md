excerpt: Protein structure alignment of PilC
---

<div class="notice--info">
  <b>Objective:</b> align protein structure PilC from MPAO1, PAO1, and PA14. PilC is a phage receptor that PfsE binds to so looking at structure differences may help identify potential limitations in Pf superinfection or propagation across strains.
  <ul>
    <li>Compare structure to see structure differences.</li>
    <li>Compare amino acid sequence to see residue differences.</li>
  </ul>
