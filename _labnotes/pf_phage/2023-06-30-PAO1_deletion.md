<div class="notice--info">
  <b>Objective:</b> Check potential antiviral or phage-related genes in PAO1 deletion region.
  <ul>
    <li>Run phaster to determine all prophage regions and possible gene function.</li>
    <li>Run DefenseFinder to look if deleted region was an antiviral system.</li>
    <li>Compare Roary generated homology between PAO1, MPAO1, and PA14 to see if other other gene annotation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Results
- Check Phaster but no prophage hits in region
- Check DefenseFinder but no antiviral systems near region or even homologous regions in MPAO1 and PA14
- Check gene annotations of homologous genes in PA14 and MPAO1
